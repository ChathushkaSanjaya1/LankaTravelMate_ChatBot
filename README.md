To begin using the LankaTravelMate chatbot, users must first download the complete project from GitHub. Visit the GitHub repository where the project is hosted (for example:(https://github.com/ChathushkaSanjaya1/mytravelchatbot/commits author=ChathushkaSanjaya1)/mytravelchatbot) and click on the green “Code” button. From there, select the “Download ZIP” option and save the file to your computer. Once downloaded, extract the ZIP file to a suitable location on your local machine.

Before running the application, it is essential to set up the necessary environment. Ensure that Python version 3.8 or later is installed on your computer, along with SQLite, and a suitable IDE such as Visual Studio Code. Next, install the required Python libraries by opening your terminal or command prompt and executing the command: pip install flask nltk sqlite3. Additionally, for NLP functions, download essential NLTK packages using Python by entering the following commands in the Python interpreter: nltk.download('punkt') and nltk.download('wordnet').

Once the environment is ready, explore the contents of the extracted project folder. The folder includes several key files such as app.py (the main Flask web app), chatbot_engine.py (which processes user queries), db_manager.py (for handling database operations), learning.py (for capturing unknown questions), text_processing.py (for cleaning and processing text), and the SQLite database file LankaTravelMate.sql. The static and templates directories contain frontend assets like CSS, JavaScript, and the main index.html file.

To set up the database, ensure that LankaTravelMate.sql is placed in the project root directory. Then, open a terminal and navigate to the project folder. Launch SQLite by typing sqlite3 LankaTravelMate.sql. If the database needs initialization, execute the command .read LankaTravelMate.sql to create the required tables. Use the .tables command to verify successful creation of the database schema. Exit SQLite by typing .exit.

Now that the database is ready, the chatbot can be launched by running the command python app.py from the project root directory. This will start the Flask server and display the message indicating the application is running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open a web browser and enter this address to access the chatbot interface.

Using the chatbot is simple. Users can type natural language queries such as “Show me hotels in Kandy”, “Tell me about Sigiriya”, or “How to travel from Colombo to Galle?”. The chatbot processes these queries using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and responds with relevant information about travel destinations, hotels, transport options, and more in Sri Lanka.

If the chatbot encounters a question it cannot answer, it automatically logs the unknown query into a separate table in the database for future training purposes. This feature allows administrators or developers to review unanswered questions and update the chatbot knowledge base periodically to improve its learning.

For users or developers who want to enhance the chatbot with map functionality, the Google Maps API can be integrated. To do this, one must create a project on the Google Cloud Console, enable the Google Maps JavaScript API, and generate an API key. This key should be added in the index.html file by replacing the placeholder in the script source URL with the actual key.

If any issues arise during the setup or use of the chatbot, basic troubleshooting steps can be followed. For instance, if Flask is not recognized, reinstall it using pip. If there are NLP-related errors, make sure required NLTK packages are downloaded. If the chatbot doesn’t load, ensure that app.py is running, and if port 5000 is already in use, the app can be launched on a different port using flask run --port=5001.
